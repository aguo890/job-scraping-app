In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.\n\nIn-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays. This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\nMillions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in.\n\nDuring your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here https://notion.notion.site/Notion-Intern-Spotlight-d0260c4e2317490db89f367d95cb4e68 and here https://www.notion.so/blog/saluting-notions-winter-interns and TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@notionhq/video/7216440106356395306?lang=en post.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE:\n\n - Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.\n\n - Design & enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.\n\n - Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.\n\n - Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.\n\n\nQUALIFICATIONS:\n\n - Pursuing a bachelor's or master’s degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Must graduate before July 2027.\n\n - Previous internship experience.\n\n - Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.\n\n - You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.\n\n - You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.\n\n - This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU’LL NEED TO BRING:\n\n - Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n\n - For a backend internship: You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus.\n\n - For a frontend internship: You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, & React) and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.\n\n - Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.\n\n - Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\n\n - Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\n\n - Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\n - You don’t need to be an AI expert, but you’re curious and willing to adopt AI tools to work smarter and deliver better results\n\n\nNICE TO HAVES:\n\n - You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres.\n\n - You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\n - You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Autonomy:</strong> We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company\"><u>Engineers lead product teams</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products\"><u>make product decisions</u></a>.

We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto\"><u>cracked engineers</u></a> who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Time for building:</strong> Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule\"><u>meeting-free days</u></a>, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Ambition:</strong> We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Being weird:</strong> Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping <em>literally</em> every product that relates to customer data. It means building an <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>objectively unnecessary developer toy</u></a> with dubious shareholder value.

Our current team is distributed between GMT-8 and GMT+2, so we currently only hire in these timezones.\n\n - 🎤 Interview process: 1) Call with one of our Talent Partners, 2) 60min technical interview, and 3) 15min call with a co-founder, 4) PostHog SuperDay (paid day of work). Read more about our interview process. https://posthog.com/handbook/people/hiring-process\n\n - 🖥️ Team: New team, Tasks - with Peter https://posthog.com/community/profiles/32304\n\n - 💰 Compensation: Please check our compensation calculator https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation.\n\n - 🦔 Read more about how we hire https://posthog.com/blog/how-we-do-hiring-and-hr-at-posthog and how we think about diversity & inclusion https://posthog.com/handbook/company/diversity.\n\n\nABOUT POSTHOG\n\nWe're shipping every product that companies need https://posthog.com/handbook/why-does-posthog-exist to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software.\n\nWe started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort https://posthog.com/handbook/story. We've since shipped more than a dozen products https://posthog.com/products, including:\n\n - A built-in data warehouse https://posthog.com/docs/data-warehouse, so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights.\n\n - A customer data platform https://posthog.com/docs/cdp, so they can send their data wherever they need with ease.\n\n - PostHog AI https://posthog.com/ai, an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries.\n\nNext on the roadmap are CRM, Workflow, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!\n\nWe are:\n\n 1. Product-led. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.\n\n 2. Default alive https://paulgraham.com/aord.html. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.\n\n 3. Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.\n\nWe're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as weird as possible https://posthog.com/deskhog.\n\n\nTHINGS WE CARE ABOUT\n\n - Transparency: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our public company handbook https://posthog.com/handbook. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.\n\n - Autonomy: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead product teams https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company and make product decisions https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed.\n\n - Shipping fast: Why not now? https://posthog.com/handbook/values#why-not-now We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.\n\n - Time for building: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are meeting-free days https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.\n\n - Ambition: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.\n\n - Being weird: Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an objectively unnecessary developer toy https://posthog.com/deskhog with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun.\n\n\nWHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR\n\nWe’re looking for a full-stack engineer who knows how to leverage LLMs to make PostHog 10x more powerful. You’ve built and shipped agentic AI applications before and understand it’s more than just hitting an API with a good prompt.\n\nYou’ll fit right in if you:\n\n\n - Ship end-to-end AI apps — from backend infra to frontend UX.\n\n - Collaborate widely — work across teams, find the right people, and make progress fast.\n\n - Think like a product builder — care about users and outcomes, not just code.\n   \n\nIf you’ve worked in autonomous agents, workflow automation, or AI copilots before, you’ll feel at home — but here you’ll get to build it from scratch, in the open, with massive impact.\n\n\nWHAT MAKES THIS ROLE UNIQUE\n\nIn this role, you’re not hacking together an AI agent hoping someone will use it — you’re building on top of a firehose of real customer data with immediate impact, whether that means creating new AI-powered tools or building observability features that help others understand how their agents perform in the wild.\n\n - Impact from day one: You’re building agents on top of real customer data — not toy demos, not “when we get users.”\n\n - Data advantage: PostHog already collects all the context agents need to be useful: analytics, sessions, events, feature flags, and more.

It means iterating on their feedback https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering, owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work.\n\n - Collaborating with design (when necessary).

More broadly, Codex Runtime is the distributed systems substrate that enables large numbers of supervised AI agents to run inside OpenAI’s and customers’ data centers, tackling increasingly complex goals over long time horizons.

Execs, product, and GTM teams can't make good decisions without the data we provide.\n\nWe launch new products all the time and we always want to do what makes sense for customers rather than fit things into a rigid existing system. That means we need to build billing infrastructure that's modular enough to support whatever we throw at it next, fast enough to iterate on without breaking things, and reliable enough that the numbers are always right. Getting all three perfect at once is impossible - finding the right balance is the main challenge. Are we there yet? Not even close. But you'll help us get there faster.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\n - Scaling our billing system to $100M+ revenue (the hundy https://www.linkedin.com/posts/posthog_scaling-with-product-led-growth-going-from-activity-7419734364248317952-GQFX) by the end of 2026, and well beyond (the billy?).\n\n - Building billing primitives flexible enough that launching a new pricing model doesn't require rearchitecting everything.\n\n - Making our usage reporting and limiting near-realtime.\n\n - Turning usage and messy raw invoice data into actionable internal reports, accurate forecasts, and compliant financials.\n\n - Making all of the above go brrr.\n\nExample projects:\n\nPostHog is generally very open about what we build, but our billing repo understandably isn't. Here's a taste of what we're working on right now though (see our team page https://posthog.com/teams/billing for more):\n\n - Implementing a new, ledger-based revenue model and re-building all dashboards and investor reports on top of it.\n\n - Making billing the source of truth for pricing, subscriptions and invoicing.\n\n - Shipping 5+ pricing launches and changes this quarter, including two new pricing models.\n\n\nYOU’LL FIT RIGHT IN IF:\n\n - Strong backend engineer. Python, SQL, and complex data modeling should feel like home.\n\n - Edge cases make you excited, not anxious.\n\n - Experience with data pipelines, task queues, and workflow orchestration - we still have a lot of Celery but are leaning more into Temporal and Dagster.\n\n - If you've done something manually twice (or seen someone else do it) - you're already building an automation or an internal tool to make it easier.\n\n - Happy paths are maybe 10% of billing. You treat error handling, rollbacks, and retries as the actual work - not TODOs you'll \"get to later\".\n\n - You don't need someone to tell you what to build. You've started a company, led a major project from scratch, or shipped an impressive side project.\n\nNice to haves:\n\n - You've built and scaled usage-based billing systems before (and have the scars to prove it).\n\n - You get weirdly excited about revenue modeling, forecasting and accounting ledgers.\n\n - You have a decent guess which one of these we made up: Q2C / AR / B2R / GAAP / ASC 606 / NRR.\n\nThis role is not for you if:\n\n - You only want to work with other engineers - billing touches every team at PostHog, from product to finance to GTM to marketing.\n\n - You need clearly defined requirements before you start building.\n\n - You think billing is a solved problem - we thought so too, once.\n\nIf you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!\n\n#LI-DNI"

You’ll drive offensive research, produce technical deliverables, and serve as OpenAI’s primary technical counterpart for select external partners (including potential U.S. government stakeholders).\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\n - Build an AI Stack Threat Map across the AI lifecycle, from data to deployment\n\n - Deliver deep-dive reports on vulnerabilities and mitigations for training and inference, focused on systemic, cross-layer risks.\n\n - Orchestrate inputs across research, engineering, security, and policy to produce crisp, actionable outputs.\n\n - Engage external partners as the primary technical representative; align deliverables to technical objectives and milestones.\n\n - Perform hands-on threat modeling, red-team design, and exploitation research across heterogeneous infrastructures (compilers, runtimes, and control planes.)\n\n - Translate complex technical issues for technical and executive audiences; brief on risk, impact, and mitigations.\n\nYou may thrive if you:\n\n - Have led high-stakes security research programs with external sponsors (e.g., national-security or critical-infrastructure stakeholders).\n\n - Have deep experience with cutting edge offensive-security techniques\n\n - Are fluent across AI/ML infrastructure (data, training, inference, schedulers, accelerators) and can threat-model end-to-end.\n\n - Operate independently, align diverse teams, and deliver on tight timelines.\n\n - Communicate clearly and concisely with experts and decision-makers.\n\nGoals & impact\n\n - Provide decision-makers a common vulnerability taxonomy, early warning of systemic weaknesses, and a repeatable methodology that measurably raises the bar for adversaries.\n\n - Outcomes include: more resilient AI architectures, reduced exploit windows, and better-targeted security R&D investments across defense and public-sector stakeholders.\n\nKey technical challenges\n\n - End-to-end coverage: Tracking threats across the AI lifecycle, including data, software, and system-level components.\n\n - Cross-disciplinary integration: Reconciling perspectives from owners of disjoint stack layers to capture composite attack paths.\n\n - Stochastic inference: Non-determinism from temperature/top-k/top-p decoding complicates reproducibility; requires seeded runs, harness control, and careful methodology to validate vulnerabilities.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA.

        "descriptionPlain": "About the Team\n\nThe Agent Infrastructure team at OpenAI is responsible for building systems that enable training and deployment of highly useful AI agents, both internally and for the world.\n\nWe work hand-in-hand with researchers to design and scale the environment in which agentic models are trained – providing a workspace for AI models to execute code, debug issues, and develop software just as human SWEs do. Our training environment for agentic models operates at an extremely high scale and has the flexibility to emulate any environment in which an agent might work.\n\nAt the same time, our team builds and maintains OpenAI’s core platform for the deployment and execution of agents in production. Our systems power products such as Codex, Operator, tool use in ChatGPT, and future agentic products. \n\nSome of the most challenging technical problems in scaling the capabilities and utility of agents and agentic models lie in the infrastructure layer – and our team is focused on building the research and production systems that enable OpenAI to train the most capable models in the world, and maximize the utility of our agentic products for users around the world.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nAs a Software Engineer on the Agent Infrastructure team, you will have the opportunity to work closely with both research and product at OpenAI - building and scaling systems to train highly capable agentic models, and building the platform and integrations to launch new agents to hundreds of millions of users worldwide.\n\nYour work will consist of both building new capabilities - standing up the infrastructure and integrations needed to train more complex agentic models - and rapidly scaling these new capabilities to some of the largest compute clusters in the world. At the same time, you’ll be instrumental to the launch of agentic products at OpenAI - building, maintaining, and scaling the production platform on which all agents run.\n\nWe’re looking for people with deep experience building AI infrastructure and who are used to working closely with researchers to build high-performance systems at massive scale for novel use cases.\n\nThis role is based in San Francisco, CA or New York City, NY. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Push massive compute clusters to their limits. You will be a core contributor to a novel container orchestration platform built in-house by our team to scale far beyond what’s possible with systems like Kubernetes.\n\n - Develop and maintain FastAPI and gRPC APIs that serve as the interface for our agentic infrastructure used both in training and production.\n\n - Use Terraform to stand up and evolve complex infrastructure for both research and production.\n\n - Collaborate with research teams to stand up and optimize systems for novel AI training runs and experimental applications.\n\n \n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have deep experience working on large-scale machine learning infrastructure. You know how to reason about training at scale, identifying bottlenecks and engineering solutions to optimize system performance in training environments.\n\n - Know how to build new things from 0-1 quickly, and then scale them 1,000,000x.\n\n - Have a keen eye for performance and optimization. You know how to squeeze the most performance out of complex, globally-distributed systems.\n\n - Know your way around cloud platforms and work with infrastructure-as-code tech like Terraform.\n\n - Are driven by solving complex, ambiguous problems at the intersection of infrastructure scalability, virtualization efficiency, and agentic capabilities.\n\n - Have deep technical expertise in virtualization and containerization technologies (e.g. Kata, Firecracker, gVisor, Sysbox) and are passionate about optimizing runtime performance.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates.

        "descriptionPlain": "About the Team\n\nWe’re hiring software engineers to make the Workload team more productive. The Workload team maintains the core components of OpenAI’s training and inference frameworks and helps execute frontier experiments.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe’re looking for someone who cares about the developer experience of working in and around OpenAI’s core training and inference frameworks.\n\n\nIn this role you will:\n\n - Be responsible for optimizing the development workflows of the engineers around you\n\n - Work within various Workload teams to address their specific needs, but collaborate with the centralized teams that own various aspects of development experience\n\n - Optimize iteration speed, both broadly, and in particular by optimizing specific teams’ CI\n\n - Improve reliability, for instance, by driving testing strategy for particular components\n\n - Work through the long tail of things that it takes to build libraries and systems that will delight researchers\n\nYou might thrive in this role if:\n\n - You are motivated by helping people. You believe a thing that separates great teams from good teams are the players willing to do whatever work it takes, without ego.\n\n - You believe in the power of developer experience. Something magical happens when people can quickly and confidently iterate on a simple codebase, but this magic is fragile and must be fought for.\n\n - When you see someone trip over something, no matter how small, your first instinct is asking yourself what it would take for that to not happen again. Your second instinct is clicking merge on the PR you’ve already written to make it so.\n\n - You are pragmatic. You have the ability to see the world through a perfectionist’s eyes, but are not yourself a perfectionist. You know which problems to pick and when to switch to making progress on a different problem.\n\n - You like going end-to-end on things. You love co-design — that feeling when you were only able to find the right solution because you both deeply understand the users that interact with a system and the system itself.\n\n - You like working with Python\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

You understand the importance of setting the engineering quality bar for the long term success of our business, but are able to make difficult prioritizations.\n\n - Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\n\n - You don’t need to be an AI expert, but you’re curious and willing to adopt AI tools to work smarter and deliver better results\n\n\nNICE TO HAVES:\n\n - You have experience working with the following:\n   \n   - Cloud Compute and Networking technologies - Cloudflare / AWS\n   \n   - Cloud Efficiency - capacity planning, cost attribution\n   \n   - Infrastructure as Code Technologies - Terraform / Pulumi / Typescript\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

        "descriptionPlain": "ABOUT US:\n\nNotion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.\n\nIn-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\nMobile devices have reshaped personal computing—the power of a desktop now fits in our pockets. By giving everyone the building blocks to create their own tools, we'll solve more problems wherever we go. A delightful, intuitive mobile experience: that's our guiding light, and we need Android engineers to make it a reality.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE:\n\nThe Mobile Platform team’s mission is to deliver a best-in-class mobile app by making it easy to build high-quality, performant features.\n\n - You'll help mobile product teams by developing services, frameworks, and shared UI components. You’ll set the direction for how features should be built on Android.\n\n - We value building high quality apps. You'll improve the performance, reliability, and polish of our Android app.\n\n - You’ll drive developer velocity through improvements to our builds systems, mobile CI/CD, and the release process.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU'LL NEED TO BRING:\n\n - Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n\n - Ability to ship quality apps at scale: You can work with a team to build and maintain quality Android apps for a large audience. You understand the practices put in place to scale an Android engineering team.\n\n - Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\n\n - Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\n\n - Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\n - You don’t need to be an AI expert, but you’re curious and willing to adopt AI tools to work smarter and deliver better results. Ideally, you are comfortable using tools like Claude Code or Codex.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVES:\n\n - You're proficient with the technologies we rely on: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Circuit, and open to occasionally working in Rust or Typescript.\n\n - You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\n - You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

        "descriptionPlain": "About the Team\nThe team’s mission is to accelerate the secure evolution of agentic AI systems at OpenAI. To achieve this, the team designs, implements, and continuously refines security policies, frameworks, and controls that defend OpenAI’s most critical assets—including the user and customer data embedded within them—against the unique risks introduced by agentic AI.\n\nAbout the Role\nAs a Security Engineer on the Agent Security Team, you will be at the forefront of securing OpenAI’s cutting-edge agentic AI systems. Your role will involve designing and implementing robust security frameworks, policies, and controls to safeguard OpenAI’s critical assets and ensure the safe deployment of agentic systems. You will develop comprehensive threat models, partner tightly with our Agent Infrastructure group to fortify the platforms that power OpenAI’s most advanced agentic systems, and lead efforts to enhance safety monitoring pipelines at scale.\n\nWe are looking for a versatile engineer who thrives in ambiguity and can make meaningful contributions from day one. You should be prepared to ship solutions quickly while maintaining a high standard of quality and security.\n\nWe’re looking for people who can drive innovative solutions that will set the industry standard for agent security. You will need to bring your expertise in securing complex systems and designing robust isolation strategies for emerging AI technologies, all while being mindful of usability. You will communicate effectively across various teams and functions, ensuring your solutions are scalable and robust while working collaboratively in an innovative environment. In this fast-paced setting, you will have the opportunity to solve complex security challenges, influence OpenAI’s security strategy, and play a pivotal role in advancing the safe and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems.\n\nThis role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\nYou’ll be responsible for:\n\n - Architecting security controls for agentic AI – design, implement, and iterate on identity, network, and runtime-level defenses (e.g., sandboxing, policy enforcement) that integrate directly with the Agent Infrastructure stack.\n\n - Building production-grade security tooling – ship code that hardens safety monitoring pipelines across agent executions at scale.\n\n - Collaborating cross-functionally – work daily with Agent Infrastructure, product, research, safety, and security teams to balance security, performance, and usability.\n\n - Influencing strategy & standards – shape the long-term Agent Security roadmap, publish best practices internally and externally, and help define industry standards for securing autonomous AI.\n\nWe’re looking for someone with:\n\n - Strong software-engineering skills in Python or at least one systems language (Go, Rust, C/C++), plus a track record of shipping and operating secure, high-reliability services.\n\n - Deep expertise in modern isolation techniques – experience with container security, kernel-level hardening, and other isolation methods.\n\n - Hands-on network security experience – implementing identity-based controls, policy enforcement, and secure large-scale telemetry pipelines.\n\n - Clear, concise communication that bridges engineering, research, and leadership audiences; comfort influencing roadmaps and driving consensus.\n\n - Bias for action & ownership – you thrive in ambiguity, move quickly without sacrificing rigor, and elevate the security bar company-wide from day one.\n\n - Cloud security depth on at least one major provider (Azure, AWS, GCP), including identity federation, workload IAM, and infrastructure-as-code best practices.\n\n - Familiarity with AI/ML security challenges – experience addressing risks associated with advanced AI systems (nice-to-have but valuable).\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates.

We use a hybrid work model of four days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\n\nIN THIS ROLE, YOU WILL:\n\n - Design and operate CI/CD pipelines for multi-component builds (bootloader, firmware, OS images, backend, companion apps) using hermetic toolchains.\n\n - Define versioning and branching strategies; automate promotions, changelogs, and artifact retention.\n\n - Integrate unit, integration, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test results; quarantine flaky tests, auto-bisect failures, and block unsafe promotions.\n\n - Build A/B OTA update flows with verity and health checks; run staged rollouts and canaries; implement safe rollback and roll-forward strategies.\n\n - Implement code signing for binaries and firmware, generate SBOMs, run vulnerability scanning, and attach build attestations and provenance.\n\n - Manage dashboards and alerts for build health, promotion latency, failure rates, and fleet update telemetry.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU:\n\n - Have experience building and operating build and release systems for consumer devices, robotics, mobile, or embedded products.\n\n - Are proficient in scripting and automation languages such as Python or Bash.\n\n - Have strong Linux user-space fundamentals.\n\n - Have experience with GitHub Actions or Buildkite, artifact registries, and reproducible toolchains.\n\n - Have experience managing vendor BSPs and toolchains.\n\n - Have delivered secure OTA or image updates with staged rollouts at scale.\n\n - Are familiar with key management and supply-chain hardening.\n\n - Have a track record of metrics-driven improvement and continuous optimization.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA.

You’ll join a small, gritty team building both foundational infra and novel internal tools to make OpenAI's production systems reliable, performant, and observable.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\n - Own core observability infrastructure, including distributed logging, time series, and trace storage\n\n - Build AI-native tools that help engineers detect, understand, and resolve issues autonomously.\n\n - Contribute to UI experiences like dashboards, notebooking, or interactive debugging\n\n - Collaborate closely with engineers, researchers, user ops, and other teams across the company to build the next generation observability product\n\nYou Might Be a Fit If You:\n\n - Have operated large-scale distributed systems in production. ( especially logging systems or some other time series databases)\n\n - Thrive in ambiguous environments and roll up your sleeves to solve unscoped problems.\n\n - Have full-stack chops or product sensibilities—you're excited to build real tools people use.\n\n - Have strong fundamentals in systems, networking, and cloud infra (Kubernetes, AWS, etc).\n\n - Bonus: built or contributed to observability systems (e.g. Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, etc).\n\nWhy This Team\n\n - We’re both an infra and product team—building a real AI application for internal use.\n\n - Your work will directly power the reliability of GPT-based products at massive scale.\n\n - You'll help define what \"AI-powered observability\" looks like at one of the world’s most advanced AI labs.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates.

        "descriptionPlain": "About the Team\n\nOpenAI’s Inference team powers the deployment of our most advanced models - including our GPT models, 4o Image Generation, and Whisper - across a variety of platforms. Our work ensures these models are available, performant, and scalable in production, and we partner closely with Research to bring the next generation of models into the world. We're a small, fast-moving team of engineers focused on delivering a world-class developer experience while pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.\n\nWe’re expanding into multimodal inference, building the infrastructure needed to serve models that handle image, audio, and other non-text modalities. These workloads are inherently more heterogeneous and experimental, involving diverse model sizes and interactions, more complex input/output formats, and tighter coordination with product and research.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe’re looking for a software engineer to help us serve OpenAI’s multimodal models at scale. You’ll be part of a small team responsible for building reliable, high-performance infrastructure for serving real-time audio, image, and other MM workloads in production.\n\nThis work is inherently cross-functional: you’ll collaborate directly with researchers training these models and with product teams defining new modalities of interaction. You'll build and optimize the systems that let users generate speech, understand images, and interact with models in ways far beyond text.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Design and implement inference infrastructure for large-scale multimodal models.\n\n - Optimize systems for high-throughput, low-latency delivery of image and audio inputs and outputs.\n\n - Enable experimental research workflows to transition into reliable production services.\n\n - Collaborate closely with researchers, infra teams, and product engineers to deploy state-of-the-art capabilities.\n\n - Contribute to system-level improvements including GPU utilization, tensor parallelism, and hardware abstraction layers.\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have experience building and scaling inference systems for LLMs or multimodal models.\n\n - Have worked with GPU-based ML workloads and understand the performance dynamics of large models, especially with complex data like images or audio.\n\n - Enjoy experimental, fast-evolving work and collaborating closely with research.\n\n - Are comfortable dealing with systems that span networking, distributed compute, and high-throughput data handling.\n\n - Have familiarity with inference tooling like vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, or custom model parallel systems.\n\n - Own problems end-to-end and are excited to operate in ambiguous, fast-moving spaces.\n\nNice to Have:\n\n - Experience working with image generation or audio synthesis models in production.\n\n - Exposure to distributed ML training or system-efficient model design.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products.

        "descriptionPlain": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nThe Workload team is responsible for designing and running OpenAI’s LLM training and inference infrastructure that powers frontier models at massive scale. Our systems unify how researchers train and serve models, abstracting away the complexity of performance, parallelism, and execution across vast GPU/accelerator fleets. By providing this foundation, the Workload team ensures that researchers can focus on advancing model capabilities while we handle the scale, efficiency, and reliability required to bring those models to life.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe are looking for an engineer to design and implement the dataset infrastructure that powers OpenAI’s next-generation training stack. You will be responsible for building standardized dataset interfaces, scaling pipelines across thousands of GPUs, and proactively testing performance bottlenecks. In this role, you will collaborate closely with the multimodal researchers, and other infra groups to ensure datasets are unified, efficient, and easy to consume.\n\n\nIN THIS ROLE, YOU WILL:\n\n - Design and maintain standardized dataset APIs, including for multimodal (MM) data that cannot fit in memory.\n\n - Build proactive testing and scale validation pipelines for dataset loading at GPU scale.\n\n - Collaborate with teammates to integrate datasets seamlessly into training and inference pipelines, ensuring smooth adoption and a great user experience.\n\n - Document and maintain dataset interfaces so they are discoverable, consistent, and easy for other teams to adopt.\n\n - Establish safeguards and validation systems to ensure datasets remain reproducible and unchanged once standardized.\n\n - Debug and resolve performance bottlenecks in distributed dataset loading (e.g., straggler systems slowing global training).\n\n - Provide visualization and inspection tools to surface errors, bugs, or bottlenecks in datasets.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU:\n\n - Have strong engineering fundamentals with experience in distributed systems, data pipelines, or infrastructure.\n\n - Have experience building APIs, modular code, and scalable abstractions, while recognizing that abstractions ultimately serve the users and UX is an important part of the abstractions design.\n\n - Are comfortable debugging bottlenecks across large fleets of machines.\n\n - Take pride in building infrastructure that “just works,” and find joy in being the guardian of reliability and scale.\n\n - Are collaborative, humble, and excited to own a foundational (if not glamorous) part of the ML stack.\n   \n\nBonus points if you:\n\n - Have background knowledge in data math, probability, or distributed data theory.\n\n - Have worked with GPU-scale distributed systems or dataset scaling for real-time data\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

Ensure we have concrete procedures, infrastructure and partnerships to mitigate these risks and to safely handle the development of powerful AI systems\n\nPreparedness tightly connects capability assessment, evaluations, and internal red teaming, and mitigations for frontier models, as well as overall coordination on AGI preparedness. This is fast paced, exciting work that has far reaching importance for the company and for society.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are looking to hire exceptional research engineers that can push the boundaries of our frontier models. Specifically, we are looking for those that will help us shape our empirical grasp of the whole spectrum of AI safety concerns and will own individual threads within this endeavor end-to-end.\n\nYou will own the scientific validity of our frontier preparedness capability evaluations—designing new evals grounded in real threat models (including high-consequence domains like CBRN as well as cyber and other frontier-risk areas), and maintaining existing evals so they don’t stale or silently regress. You’ll define datasets, graders, rubrics, and threshold guidance, and produce auditable artifacts (evaluation cards, capability reports, system-card inputs) that leadership can trust during high-stakes launches.\n\nIn this role, you'll:\n\n - Work on identifying emerging AI safety risks and new methodologies for exploring the impact of these risks\n\n - Build (and then continuously refine) evaluations of frontier AI models that assess the extent of identified risks\n\n - Design and build scalable systems and processes that can support these kinds of evaluations\n\n - Contribute to the refinement of risk management and the overall development of \"best practice\" guidelines for AI safety evaluations\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Are passionate and knowledgeable about short-term and long-term AI safety risks\n\n - Demonstrate the ability to think outside the box and have a robust “red-teaming mindset”\n\n - Have experience in ML research engineering, ML observability and monitoring, creating large language model-enabled applications, and/or another technical domain applicable to AI risk\n\n - Are able to operate effectively in a dynamic and extremely fast-paced research environment as well as scope and deliver projects end-to-end\n\nIt would be great if you also have:\n\n - First-hand experience in red-teaming systems—be it computer systems or otherwise\n\n - A good understanding of the (nuances of) societal aspects of AI deployment\n\n - Excellent communication skills and the ability to work cross-functionally\n\nThis role may require access to technology or technical data controlled under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations or International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Therefore, this role is restricted to individuals described in paragraph (a)(1) of the definition of “U.S. person” in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. § 772.1, and in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. § 120.62. U.S. persons are U.S. citizens, U.S. legal permanent residents, individuals granted asylum status in the United States, and individuals admitted to the United States as refugees.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA.
